SiteSage is an industrial AI safety platform and real-time computer vision command center designed for high-risk construction sites. It ingests multi-camera RTSP feeds, executes real-time PPE and geofence inference, flags hazardous violations, and manages end-to-end incident investigation and OSHA 1926 compliance reporting.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture & Features

### 1. Unified Command Center (`/dashboard`)
* **Real-Time Video HUD**: Simulated multi-worker detection canvas with real-time bounding boxes (Hard Hat, High-Vis Vest, Exclusion Zones).
* **Incident Investigation Drawer**: Deep-dive triage with forensic timestamping, confidence rating, CCTV snapshot evidence, and supervisor actions.
* **Operational Metric Strip**: Site-wide compliance score, active worker headcounts, high-risk exclusion zone breaches, and camera stream health.

### 2. Multi-Camera Live Monitoring (`/monitoring`)
* **8-Camera Operational Grid**: Live scanning visualizers with per-camera threat levels (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
* **Interactive Threat Overlays**: Real-time bounding boxes and rapid incident escalation links.

### 3. Geofence & Safety Zone Designer (`/zones`)
* **Interactive Polygon Canvas**: Vector polygon editor to define exclusion zones, crane swing perimeters, and high-voltage areas directly over camera views.
* **Zone Rules Engine**: Custom dwell-time limits, PPE prerequisites, and automated alert triggering.

### 4. Camera Network Telemetry (`/cameras`)
* **Edge Node Registry**: Detailed telemetry on 27 RTSP streams, including bitrate, latency jitter, packet loss, and hardware models (Axis, Bosch, Hanwha).
* **Stream Diagnostics & Provisioning**: Camera onboarding wizard and live packet stability waveform diagnostics.

### 5. Compliance & OSHA Reports (`/reports`)
* **Official Regulatory Dossiers**: OSHA 1926 Subpart C/E compliance packages, Daily Shift Safety Briefings, and forensic video archives.
* **Subcontractor Safety League**: Automatic compliance scoring and violation tracking by contractor.
* **Cryptographic Sign-Off**: HMAC-SHA256 verified digital audit trail.

### 6. AI Rules Engine & Settings (`/settings`)
* **Confidence Sliders**: Granular thresholds for Hard Hat (85%), Safety Vest (80%), Geofence Breach (92%), and Proximity Warnings (75%).
* **Edge Hardware Monitor**: NVIDIA TensorRT INT8 GPU allocation, temperature, and inference FPS metrics.
* **Dispatch Webhooks**: Automated push to WebSockets, Twilio SMS, Motorola MOTOTRBO Radio TTS, and Slack.
